# Overview

This project show a list of pets `[`:dog::snail::cat::hamster::rabbit::fish::rat::rooster::mouse::turtle::ant:`]`.

You can filter pets by status, use the filter above the list. 

You can add a pet to the list, click on the "Add pet" button above the list - a modal will pop up.


## Running the project

Run `ng serve` and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.


## TODO

Nothing is perfect. Here's a list of things that would be great to do, but were not done:

* Unit tests (the auto-generated ones are broken)
* Slider to show all pet images in the list (or another alternative way to show all pet info, e.g. a modal or a pet page)
* Pagination of the pets list (API does not support it from what I reckoned, but still would be nice)

If you search for `TODO` in the project, you'll find a bunch of smaller improvements that as well were left behind.
